# Real Time Face Recognition, Emotion Analysis and Recording System

**Project Description:** In this project, face recognition algorithms were implemented using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade and LBPHFaceRecognizer. CRUD operations were performed by storing face and user information in a PostgreSQL database on Docker. Real-time face detection and recognition operations were performed on images from the camera stream. At the same time, with the Face Emotion Recognition test, a deep learning-based artificial intelligence model was used to recognize human faces and operations such as emotion recognition from facial expressions, age detection, gender detection and real-time emotion detection were performed.
